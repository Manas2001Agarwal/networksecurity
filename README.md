### This is my Network Security Project for Phishing data

Developed Phishing Website Classifier: Built a machine learning model to classify websites as safe or malicious, helping search engines like Google and Yahoo detect and block phishing websites to ensure user safety.

Data Ingestion & Processing: Utilized MongoDB to store and ingest data, incorporated exception handling and logging for better debugging, and tracked experiments using MLflow, with data pipelines visualized and stored in DagsHub.

Modeling & Performance Optimization: Applied Elastic-Net for binary classification, fine-tuned hyperparameters, and achieved 96% accuracy on unseen data by optimizing the model's performance.

Deployment & Automation: Developed a FastAPI front-end for user interaction, containerized the application using Docker, and deployed it on AWS EC2, automating the build and deployment process through GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD.
